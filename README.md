### Moment: AI-Powered Knowledge Social Learning Platform Technical Documentation

---

#### I. Overview

**1.1 Project Background**

With the rapid advancement of AI technology, the methods of knowledge production and dissemination have undergone profound changes. The traditional Professional Content Generator (PGC) model is gradually supplemented by AI-generated basic content, and users' acquisition and social behaviors of knowledge have also significantly evolved. To meet users' needs for personalized, instant feedback, and socialized learning, we introduce "Moment" â€“ an AI-powered knowledge social learning platform.

**1.2 Product Positioning**

"Moment" aims to break traditional learning models, constructing a user-centric, AI-assisted, and community-co-created knowledge ecosystem. Through card-style knowledge presentation, immersive learning experiences, personalized learning path recommendations, knowledge community building, and intelligent learning assistants, it provides users with efficient, convenient, and engaging learning experiences.
